<p>(these notes were last updated for version 0.3.74. Because we release so frequently (even daily), we may at times fall behind updating it.)</p>

<h3>Known Problems</h3>

<p>None yet (loads of missing features, but what’s there is thought to be solid… let us know if it’s not!).</p>

<h3>Known Limitations</h3>

<p>The Export to CSS command is only partially implemented.</p>

<p>There is no way&#160; yet customize the file naming conventions.</p>

<p>There is no good way yet to track who all the contributors were to various session components (e.g., who did the transcribing). Until this is done, its possible to make do by using with custom fields.</p>

<p>While type-ahead works&#160; on many fields, it does not yet work for entering multiple participant names.</p>

<p>You must currently use right-clicking on files to do things with them; this will soon be possible from the main-menu bar.</p>

<p>When using the “Add” button, you can only choose one file at a time.</p>
