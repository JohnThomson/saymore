New features in version 0.9:

You can control which columns are shown, in what order, and you can sort by clicking on the header of the column.
You can now record exactly who did what, when, using the Contributors tab.

New features in version 0.7:

Progress now shows nice charts. You can print these direct, or copy them to an email or report.

New features in version 0.5:

Videos are now shown with a preview image, rather than a black rectangle, when not playing.
When you correct the spelling of a person's name, the name is also updated in all events where he/she is listed as a participant.

The People list now gives an indication of the Informed Consent status of each person.  You get a warning icon if there is no consent file, and different icons for photograph, audio and video consent files.

Events now have a “Status” value, which you set. Currently, the choices are “Incoming”, “In Progress”, “Finished”, and “Skip”.  The later is for events which you don’t plan to work with or publish.

The list of Events now displays information about the workflow status in the “Stages” column.  As you add files to the event and name them appropriately (using the Rename menu), SayMore detects them and indicates their presence in the stages icon.

You can now select participants for an event by ticking the boxes next to their names.
You can now set the mug shot of a person by dragging the photo file onto the mug shot place-holder.


<h3>Known Problems</h3>

<p>None yet (loads of missing features, but what’s there is thought to be solid… let us know if it’s not!).</p>

<h3>Known Limitations</h3>

<p>The Export to CSS command is only partially implemented.</p>

<p>SayMore doesn't provide any help with Informed Consent/permission situations where someone gives universal access for some recordings, but limitted access for others.</p>

<p>There is no way&#160; yet customize the file naming conventions.</p>

<p>When using the “Add Files...” button, you can only choose one file at a time.</p>
