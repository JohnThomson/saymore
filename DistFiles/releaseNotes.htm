New features in version 0.5:

Videos are now shown with a preview image, rather than a black rectangle, when not playing.
When you correct the spelling of a person's name, the name is also updated in all events where he/she is listed as a participant.

The People list now gives an indication of the Informed Consent status of each person.  You get a warning icon if there is no consent file, and different icons for photograph, audio and video consent files.

Events now have a “Status” value, which you set. Currently, the choices are “Incoming”, “In Progress”, “Finished”, and “Skip”.  The later is for events which you don’t plan to work with or publish.

The list of Events now displays information about the workflow status in the “Stages” column.  As you add files to the event and name them appropriately (using the Rename menu), SayMore detects them and indicates their presence in the stages icon.

You can now select participants for an event by ticking the boxes next to their names.
You can now set the mug shot of a person by dragging the photo file onto the mug shot place-holder.


<h3>Known Problems</h3>

<p>None yet (loads of missing features, but what’s there is thought to be solid… let us know if it’s not!).</p>

<h3>Known Limitations</h3>

<p>The Export to CSS command is only partially implemented.</p>

<p>There is no way&#160; yet customize the file naming conventions.</p>

<p>There is no good way yet to track who all the contributors were to various session components (e.g., who did the transcribing). Until this is done, its possible to make do by using with custom fields.</p>

<p>While type-ahead works&#160; on many fields, it does not yet work for entering multiple participant names.</p>

<p>When using the “Add” button, you can only choose one file at a time.</p>
