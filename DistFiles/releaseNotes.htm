    <h3>What&#39;s New in Version 2</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>
            Version 1 of SayMore helped you get everything organized. Version 2 add many
            tools for helping you record, transcribe, convert, export, and archive.
            Optionally, you can also enlist native speakers to do time-aligned “oral
            annotation” steps, as used by the Basic Oral Language Documentation approach. In
            what follows, we summarize the changes made since Version 1.</p>
        <h1 class="style1">
            Recording</h1>
        <p>
            You can now record new sessions directly in SayMore.</p>
        <blockquote class="style2">
            <p>
                <em>We plead with you to avoid using your laptop’s built-in microphone; if you
                are willing to give up usefulness for future phonetic research, an OK USB
                headset can be had for US$35 or less in many countries. Note that the very
                popular Zoom H2’s can also be plugged in and used as a microphone (in a lower
                quality mode).</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            All recording tools now feature a level meter which also indicates which device
            SayMore is recording from, to reduce the chances that you think you’re recording
            from, say, a headset, but really the computer is listening to the laptop’s
            built-in microphone.</p>
        <h1 class="style1">
            Transcription</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>SayMore now has an easy-to-use transcription tool, which looks like a table.
                Each row is a “segment”. Before you can transcribe, you need to make these
                segments, and you can do that in one of 3 ways:</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote class="style2">
            <p>
                1) If you’re doing BOLD, just set a native speaker up with the CarefulSpeech
                tool. Each chunk of speech he/she repeats becomes a segment.</p>
            <p>
                2) You can use the Manual Segmenter</p>
            <p>
                3) Try our experimental Auto-segmenter</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>In the Transcription tool, you can now choose what audio is played when the
                cursor is in the row. Original recording, careful recording or oral translation.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1 class="style1">
            Oral Annotation</h1>
        <p>
            The Careful Speech and Oral Translation tools, which support the BOLD way of
            working, are designed to be super simple so that you can quickly train a native
            speaker to do these tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A single key (space bar) is all that is needed to do the whole task.</li>
            <li>If there are segments you don’t want to annotate, you can mark them as
                “ignored”.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 class="style1">
            File Format Handling</h1>
        <p>
            Many audio and video formats can now be converted to standard, future-friendly
            formats, right in SayMore.</p>
        <h1 class="style1">
            Export</h1>
        <p>
            In addition to the ELAN file compatibility, Audacity import, and FLEx export,
            this version adds the following exports:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plain text</li>
            <li>CSV (comma-separated-value) for spreadsheets</li>
            <li>SFM (Toolbox)</li>
            <li>SRT Subtitle format</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 class="style1">
            MetaData</h1>
        <p>
            As before, SayMore tries to figure out which recordings have gone through which
            stages of the workflow. If it gets it wrong, then you can use the new &quot;status
            and Stages&quot; tab can now manually take control of the stage for each session.</p>
        <p>
            <br />
        </p>

    </ul>


    <h3>New features in version 1.5:</h3>
    Built-in &quot;Careful Speech&quot; and &quot;Oral Translation&quot; tools for those
    doing BOLD (Basic Oral Language Documentation).<h3>New features in version 1.3:</h3>
    Built-inTranscription, stored using ELAN&#39;s file format, with export for
    FieldWorks Language Explorer (FLEx) interlinear.<h3>New features in version 1.1:</h3>
    Built-in packaging for REAP, SIL's Corporate Archive<br />
 <h3>New features in version 0.9:</h3>
    Documentation.(thanks Marlon!)<br />
You can control which columns are shown, in what order, and you can sort by clicking on the header of the column.
<br/>You can now record exactly who did what, when, using the Contributors tab.
<br/>
    <h3>New features in version 0.7:</h3>
Progress now shows nice charts. You can print these direct, or copy them to an email or report.
<h3>New features in version 0.5:</h3>
Videos are now shown with a preview image, rather than a black rectangle, when not playing.
When you correct the spelling of a person's name, the name is also updated in all events where he/she is listed as a participant.
<br/>
The People list now gives an indication of the Informed Consent status of each person.  You get a warning icon if there is no consent file, and different icons for photograph, audio and video consent files.
<br/>
Events now have a “Status” value, which you set. Currently, the choices are “Incoming”, “In Progress”, “Finished”, and “Skip”.  The later is for events which you don’t plan to work with or publish.
<br/>
The list of Events now displays information about the workflow status in the “Stages” column.  As you add files to the event and name them appropriately (using the Rename menu), SayMore detects them and indicates their presence in the stages icon.
<br/>
You can now select participants for an event by ticking the boxes next to their names.
You can now set the mug shot of a person by dragging the photo file onto the mug shot place-holder.
<br/>

<h3>Known ProbleKnown Problems</h3>
<p>Some users are finding they cannot rename media files, because the process which
    shows them (MediaPlayer.exe) is holding on to them when it should not.&nbsp;
    Apparently a symptom of this is that multiple MediaPlayers can be found running
    in the Windows process list.&nbsp; However, we have not yet been able to make
    this happen on developer machines, which makes it very hard to fix.&nbsp; If you
    can reliably make it happen, please contacting us!</p>
<h3>Known LimitationsThe Export to CSS command is only partially implemented.</p>

<p>SayMore doesn't provide any help with Informed Consent/permission situations where someone gives universal access for some recordings, but limitted access for others.</p>

<p>There is no way yet to customize the file naming conventions.</p>

<p>When using the “Add Files...” button, you can only choose one file at a time.</p>
